# Code Quiz

## Description

The quiz created is to test the users knowledge of JavaScript and display their results afterwards. It also give the user the ability to clear the high score if they wish and restart the game to get a better score.

## Challenges

One of my biggest challenges with this assignment was near the end. After running through the application I noticed that the high scores were duplicating and not showing the result in the right order. 

Using the elements tab in dev tools, I realized that the `li` was not appended to the `ul` created in the HTML file. Once I appended the two together, the high scores were no longer duplicated and displayed the results in the correct order! 

Going forward, I know I need to use the dev tools more often to help me debug issues that arise throughout my coding career.
